#### Research statemant
I completed both my undergraduate and master's programs at SUSTech, where I had the opportunity to learn from many great scholars. As a sophomore, I attended a seminar on algebraic geometry led by [Prof. Li Zhan](https://sites.google.com/site/mathzhanli/curriculum-vitae). This seminar was designed for beginners and served as an excellent introduction to the subject.

During my master's program, under the supervision of [Prof. Longting Wu](https://longtingwu.github.io/), I focused on computing explicit formulas for several types of relative Gromov-Witten invariants. Building on the results of [Honglu Fan, Longting Wu, and Fenglong You](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07133), I explored explicit formulas for $P^1 \times P^1$, leveraging its symmetry. However, for general Hirzebruch surfaces, the partial differential equation (PDE) approach may ne inapplicable.

When the PDE method reached its limits, we turned to the combinatorial techniques utilized by [Markus Reineke and Thorsten Weist](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07778). Due the GW/DT correspondence, counting curves in $P^2$ is equivalent to counting DT invariants of Kronecker quivers.

[Prof. Pierrick Bousseau](https://math.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/CV_3.pdf) addressed a similar problem in his paper, [On an example of quiver DT/relative GW correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07133). Subsequent [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00503), derives the same recursion formulas as the work of Fan, Wu, and You. On the quiver side, the initial data for these GW invariants are directly accessible.

One particularly intriguing aspect of this research is a numerical relationship between the relative GW invariants of $P^2$ and $P^1 \times P^1$. This connection appears on the quiver side, and I strongly believe it has a beautiful geometric explanation waiting to be uncovered.
