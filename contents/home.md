#### Research statemant
I finished my undergraduate and master Program in SUSTech. There are lots of great scholars. I attanded the seminar of [Prof. Li Zhan](https://sites.google.com/site/mathzhanli/curriculum-vitae) as a sophomore, which was provided for beginers to learn algebraic geometry.
<br>
As I get into my master program, my supervisor [Prog. Longting Wu](https://longtingwu.github.io/) gave me a topic to further compute explicit formula of several types relative Gromov-Witten invariants. Following the result of [Honglu Fan, Longting Wu, Fenglong You ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07133), it is possible to derive explicit formula of $P^1\times P^1$ due to the symmetry. However, for general Hirzebruch surfaces, the method via PDE seems do not apply. 
<br>
As the direct approach was hopeless, we decided to turn our attention to the work of [Markus Reineke, Thorsten Weist](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07778) since they apply combinatorial technology to deal this question.
